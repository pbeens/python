# README.md

A quick test to see if the progress bar method documented [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-to-use-progress-bars-in-python-2dc436de81e5) works, and it does!

Note that you must have the progress.bar library installed, which you can do with `pip install progress.bar` in your Python Scripts folder.

[Here's](progress-bar-test.py) the Python file.
